Question-4. Canvas and SVG tags
<!--
SVG
    SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics
    
    SVG is used to define graphics for the Web

    SVG is a W3C recommendation

    The HTML <svg> element is a container for SVG graphics.

    SVG has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and graphic images.
        for example:
            <!DOCTYPE html>
            <html>
            <body>
            <svg width="100" height="100">
            <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="green" stroke-width="4" fill="yellow" />
            </svg>
            </body>
            </html>

    Resolution independent

    Support for event handlers

    Best suited for applications with large rendering areas (Google Maps)

    Not suited for game applications

CANVAS
    Canvas draws 2D graphics, on the fly (with JavaScript).

    Canvas is rendered pixel by pixel.

    In canvas,once the graphic is drawn,it is forgotten by the browser.If its position should be changed,the entire scene needs to be redrawn,including any objects that might have been covered by the graphic.

    Resolution dependent

    No support for event handlers

    You can save the resulting image as .png or .jpg

    Well suited for graphic-intensive games
