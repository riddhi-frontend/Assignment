Question-2: What is promises?
<!-- 
    A promise in JavaScript is a powerful construct that allows you to handle asynchronous operations more elegantly.
    A promise is a special JavaScript object that acts as a placeholder (proxy) for the value of an ongoing operation.
    It represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous task and its resulting value.
    Promises are commonly used when dealing with tasks that take time, such as making API requests, reading files, or waiting for user input.
    A promise can be in one of three states:
        Pending: Initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
        Fulfilled: The operation completed successfully, and the promise has a value.
        Rejected: The operation failed, and the promise has an error reason.
    Once a promise transitions from pending to either fulfilled or rejected, it becomes “settled.”
    Promises allow you to chain asynchronous actions together.
    You can use the .then(), .catch(), and .finally() methods to associate further actions with a promise.
        Example:
            fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
            .then(response => response.json()) // Handle successful response
            .then(data => console.log(data))
            .catch(error => console.error('Error fetching data:', error)); // Handle errors
        Creating a Promise:
            const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            // Producing code (may take some time)
             if (/* condition */) {
                resolve('Success!'); // Resolve the promise
                }
            else {
                reject(new Error('Something went wrong.')); // Reject the promise
                }
            });
    Use .then() to handle the resolved value and .catch() to handle errors.
    The .finally() method allows you to execute code regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected.
        Note: promises make asynchronous code more manageable and help avoid callback hell.They provide a cleaner way to handle asynchronous tasks and improve code readability
