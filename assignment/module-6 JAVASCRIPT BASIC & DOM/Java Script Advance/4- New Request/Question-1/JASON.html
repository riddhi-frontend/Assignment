Question-1: What is JSON?
<!-- 
    JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format.
    It’s commonly used for storing and transmitting data between different systems.
    Format: JSON uses human-readable text to represent data objects. It consists of attribute–value pairs and arrays.
Syntax: Data in JSON is organized into name/value pairs separated by commas. Objects are enclosed in curly braces {} and arrays in square brackets [].
Example:
JSON

{
    "employees": [
        {"firstName": "John", "lastName": "Doe"},
        {"firstName": "Anna", "lastName": "Smith"},
        {"firstName": "Peter", "lastName": "Jones"}
    ]
}

Conversion to JavaScript: JSON data can be easily converted into native JavaScript objects using JSON.parse().
Use Cases: It’s commonly used for transmitting data between a server and a web page, as well as for APIs and configuration files
