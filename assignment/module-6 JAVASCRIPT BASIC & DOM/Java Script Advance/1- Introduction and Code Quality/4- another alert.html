<!-- Question: What is the code below going to output? alert( null || 2 || undefined ); -->
<script>
    alert(null || 2 || undefined); // 2
</script>

<!-- The || operator in JavaScript returns the first truthy value it encounters.
    In this case, null and undefined are both falsy values, so the operator skips them and returns the first truthy value it finds, which is 2. -->
