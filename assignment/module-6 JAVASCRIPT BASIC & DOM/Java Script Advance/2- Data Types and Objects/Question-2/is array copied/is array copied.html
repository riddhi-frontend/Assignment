Question: Is array copied?
    let fruits = ["Apples", "Pear", "Orange"]; // push a new value into the "copy"
    let shoppingCart = fruits; shoppingCart.push("Banana"); // what's in fruits?
    alert( fruits.length ); // ?

<!--
    Yes, in this case, the fruits array is copied by reference to the shoppingCart variable. This means that both fruits and shoppingCart refer to the same array in memory.

    When you push "Banana" into the shoppingCart array, you are actually modifying the original fruits array.

    Therefore, if you check the length of the fruits array using alert(fruits.length), it will output 4, since it now contains "Apples", "Pear", "Orange", and "Banana".
