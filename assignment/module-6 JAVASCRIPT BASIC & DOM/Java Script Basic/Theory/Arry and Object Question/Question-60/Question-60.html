Q.60 Array vs obpject defences in JS?  
<!-- 
    Arrays:
        best used for ordered collections of items.
        methods like push(), pop(), shift(), unshift(), and splice() for easy manipulation.
        Use integer indices to access elements.
        Are ideal for scenarios where you need to iterate over elements in sequence.
        Example: let fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];

    Objects:
        Are best used for collections of items with named properties.
        Are essentially associative arrays (also known as hash maps in other languages).
        Use string or symbol keys to access properties.
        Are suitable for scenarios where you need to access elements via a unique key.
        Example:
                let fruitColors = {
                    apple: 'red',
                    banana: 'yellow',
                    cherry: 'red'
                };
