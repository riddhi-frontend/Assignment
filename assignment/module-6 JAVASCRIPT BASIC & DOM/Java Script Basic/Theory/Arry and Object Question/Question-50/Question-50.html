Q.50 What is the drawback of declaring methods directly in JavaScript objects?  
<!-- 
    The drawback of declaring methods directly in JavaScript objects is that each object instance will have its own copy of the method.
    This can lead to increased memory usage, especially if you have a large number of objects.
    When declaring methods directly in JavaScript objects, there are a few drawbacks to consider:
        1) Memory Inefficiency:
            If you create methods inside the constructor (using this), each instance of the object will have its own copy of those methods.
            This can lead to memory inefficiency, especially when multiple instances of the same class are produced.
            In contrast, methods defined on the prototype chain are created once and then shared by all instances1.0

        2) Inheritance Complexity:
            Assigning methods to this makes inheritance less convenient.
            When using the prototype approach, inheritance is more straightforward because methods are inherited from the prototype chain1.

        3) Not True Constructors:
            Returning an object literal from a constructor (without using new) doesn’t create a true constructor.
            It doesn’t behave like a typical constructor, and instance of checks won’t work as expected.

    Example: const obj1 =
            {
                name: 'Object 1',
                sayHello: function()
                {
                    console.log(`Hello, I am ${this.name}!`);
                }
            };
    obj1.sayHello(); // logs "Hello, I am Object 1!"
