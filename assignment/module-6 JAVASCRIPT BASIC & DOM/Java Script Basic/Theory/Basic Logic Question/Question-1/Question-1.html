Question-1: What is JavaScript. How to use it?
<!-- 
JavaScript is a scripting or lightweight programming language commonly used by web developers to add dynamic interactions to web pages, applications, servers, and even games, animate images, and update content in real-time.

It works seamlessly alongside HTML and CSS, complementing CSS in formatting HTML elements while providing user interaction, a capability that CSS alone lacks. 

To use JavaScript, you can either embed it directly into your HTML code using the <script> tag or link to an external JavaScript file using the src attribute.

Example:
    <html>
    <head>
	<title>Inline JavaScript</title>
	<script type="text/javascript">
		alert("Hello World");
	</script>
    </head>
    <body>
    </body>
    </html>
        In this example, the JavaScript code is executed as soon as the page loads, displaying an alert box with the message "Hello World".
