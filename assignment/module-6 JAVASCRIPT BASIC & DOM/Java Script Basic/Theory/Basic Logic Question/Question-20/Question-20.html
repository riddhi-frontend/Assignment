Question-20: What is the difference between && and || in JavaScript?
<!-- 
    The differences between the logical operators && (AND) and || (OR) in JavaScript:
    1. AND (`&&`):
        The `&&` operator returns true if all conditions are true.
        If any condition is false, the entire expression evaluates to false.
            Example: (x < 10 && y > 1) is true only if both x is less than 10 and y is greater than 1.

    2. OR (`||`)**:
        The || operator returns true if at least one condition is true.
        If all conditions are false, the entire expression evaluates to false.
            Example: (x == 5 || y == 5) is false because neither x nor y equals 5.
