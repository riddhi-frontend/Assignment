Question-5: What the deference between undefined and undeclare in JavaScript?
<!-- 
    Undefined Variable: An “undefined” variable is one that has been declared but hasn’t been assigned any value yet.
        Example:let x;
                console.log(x); // Output: undefined
                x = 5; // Now, the variable is no longer undefined.
                console.log(x); // Output: 5

    Undeclared Variable:A variable is undeclared when it has not been declared or initialized in the code.
                        It means the variable does not exist because it has not been created.
                        If you try to access an undeclared variable, JavaScript will throw a ReferenceError.
        Example:console.log(myVariable)
