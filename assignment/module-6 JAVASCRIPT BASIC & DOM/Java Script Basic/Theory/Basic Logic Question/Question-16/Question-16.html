Question-16: What is the result of the expression (true && 1 && "hello")?
<!-- 
    The result of the expression (true && 1 && "hello") is “hello”.
    The logical AND (&&) operator evaluates each operand from left to right and returns the last truthy value encountered.
    In this case,all three operands are truthy,so the result is the string “hello”.
