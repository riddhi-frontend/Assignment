Question-2: How many type of Variable in JavaScript?
<!-- In JavaScript there are three main types of variables:
    1. Var
        This keyword was used in JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.
        used to declare a variable that can be redeclare and redefined.
        However, itâ€™s considered outdated now and should only be used for compatibility with older browsers.
            Example:
                var x = 10;
                console.log(x); // Output: 10

    2. Let
        Introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), let allows you to declare variables that can be reassigned. Use it when you need to change the value of a variable during execution.
        used to declare a variable that can be redefined but not redcalare.
            Example:
                let y = 20;
                console.log(y); // Output: 20

    3. Const
        Also introduced in ES6, const declares variables with constant values that cannot be changed after initialization. Use it for values that should remain constant throughout your code, such as configuration settings or fixed values.
        used to declare a variable that cannot be redcalare  redefined.
            Example:
                const z = 30;
                console.log(z); // Output: 30
