Question-18: What is a Loop and Switch Case in JavaScript define that ?
<!-- 
    1.Loops:
        Loops allow you to execute a set of instructions repeatedly until a specific condition is met.
        In JavaScript, there are several types of loops:
            1. for: Executes a block of code a specified number of times.
            2. while: Repeats a block of code while a given condition is true.
            3. do...while: Similar to the `while` loop, but it always executes the code block at least once.

    2.Switch Case Statement:
        The `switch` statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.
        It evaluates an expression once and compares its value with different cases.
        If a match is found, the associated code block is executed.
            Syntax:
                switch (expression)
                {
                    case value1:
                        break;
                    case value2:
                        break;
                    default:
                }
        Example: using `switch` to categorize age:
            let age = 19;
            switch (age)
            {
                case 13:
                case 14:
                case 15:
                    console.log("Early Teen");
                    break;
                case 18:
                case 19:
                    console.log("Late Teen");
                    break;
                default:
                    console.log("Other age group");
            }
    This will print "Late Teen" for an age of 19.
