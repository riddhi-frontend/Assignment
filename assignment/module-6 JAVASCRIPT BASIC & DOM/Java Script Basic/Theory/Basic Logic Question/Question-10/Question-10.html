Question-10: What is Condition Statement?
<!-- 
    In JavaScript, a conditional statement is a statement that performs different actions based on whether a specified condition is true or false.
    The most common conditional statements are if, else if, and else.
    Example:
        let age = 25;
            if (age < 13)
            {
            console.log("You are a child.");
            }
            else if 
            (age < 18)
            {
        console.log("You are a teenager.");
        }
        else
        {
    console.log("You are an adult.");
}
