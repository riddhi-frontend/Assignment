Question-9: Write a JavaScript program to calculate days left until next Christmas?
<script>
    let today = new Date();
    let christmasYear = today.getFullYear();
        if (today.getMonth() == 11 && today.getDate() > 25)
            {
                christmasYear = christmasYear + 1;
            }
    let christmasDate = new Date(christmasYear, 11, 25);
    let dayMilliseconds = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24;

    let remainingDays = Math.ceil
    (
    (christmasDate.getTime() - today.getTime()) /
    (dayMilliseconds)
    );

console.log("There are " + remainingDays + " days remaining until Christmas.");
</script>
