Question-3: Define a Data Types in js?
<!-- 
    There are two main data types:

    1. Primitive Types:

        A) Number: Represents both integers and floating-point numbers.
            Example:let x = 42;
                    let y = 3.14;

        B) String: Represents textual data and is enclosed in quotes (single or double).        
            Example:let greeting = "hello";
                    let farewell = 'goodbye';

        C) Boolean: Represents true or false values.
            Example:let isAdmin = true;
                    let isGuest = false;

        D) Null: Represents the intentional absence of any value.
            Example:let lorem = null;

        E) Undefined: Indicates that a variable has been declared but not assigned a value.
            Example:let ipsum;
                    console.log(ipsum); // Output: undefined

        F) Symbol: Used for unique identifiers (added in ES6).
            Example:let sym1 = Symbol("foo");
                    let obj = { [sym]: "bar" };
                    console.log(obj[sym]); // Output: "bar"

        G) BigInt: Used for very large integers (greater than 2^53 - 1).
            Example:let bigIntValue = BigInt(123456789012345678901234567890n);
            // Output: 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n

    2. Complex Types

        A) Object: Represents a collection of key-value pairs arrays, and other objects.
            Example:let user = 
                {
                    name: "John Doe",
                    age: 42,
                };

        B) Array: An array data type is a collection of values of any data type, including strings, numbers, booleans, objects, and other arrays.
            Example:let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
                    let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];
                    let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

        C) Function: A function data type is a block of code that can be executed repeatedly with different inputs.
            Example:function greet(name)
            {
                console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
            }
