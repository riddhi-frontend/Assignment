Question-22: Check Number Is Positive or Negative in JavaScript?
<!-- 
Certainly! There are a few ways to check whether a number is positive, negative, or zero in JavaScript. Let me explain a couple of methods:
-->
<script>
// Program that checks if the number is positive, negative, or zero
const number = parseInt(prompt("Enter a number: "));
    if
    (number > 0)
    {
        console.log("The number is positive");
    }
    else if (number === 0)
    {
        console.log("The number is zero");
    }
    else
    {
        console.log("The number is negative");
    }
</script>
