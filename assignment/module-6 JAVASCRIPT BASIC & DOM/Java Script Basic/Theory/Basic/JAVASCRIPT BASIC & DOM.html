Question:1 What is JavaScript?

<!--
    javascript is client side scripting language.

    javascript called inside of head and body inside of script tag

    javascript is a case senstive language.
        examples : document.getElementById("id");

    javascript is used as programming language.
        examples : 2+2=4 

    javascript manage and maintain by ECM scmascript organizations. 

    javascript is used to load dynamic content inside of broswers.

    javascript called as external javascript inside of <script src="external.js"> </script>

Question:2 What is the use of isNaN function?

<!--
    The isNaN() function is a global function in JavaScript that determines whether a value is NaN (Not-a-Number).

    The isNaN() function in JavaScript is used to check if a given value is not a number.

    The isNaN() function returns true if the passed argument is not a number, otherwise it returns false.
-->

Question:3 What is negative Infinity?

<!--
    In JavaScript,the value -Infinity represents negative infinity.

    It is a special value that represents the lowest possible number that is less than all other numbers.

    Negative infinity is often used in mathematical operations where there is no result,such as dividing a negative number by zero.In this case, the result is -Infinity.

Question:4 Which company developed JavaScript?

<!--
    JavaScript was developed by Netscape Communications Corporation in 1995,as a part of their Netscape Navigator web browser.

    It was originally called "LiveScript",but was later renamed to "JavaScript" to capitalize on the popularity of Java,a programming language developed by Sun Microsystems.

    The development of JavaScript was led by Brendan Eich,who was working at Netscape at the time.

    The language was designed to be easy to learn and use,with a focus on enabling web developers to create dynamic and interactive web pages.

    JavaScript has become one of the most popular programming languages in the world,and is widely used in web development,server-side programming,and mobile application development.

    It is supported by all modern web browsers,and is an essential part of the web development ecosystem.

Question:5 What are undeclared and undefined variables?

<!--
    An undeclared variable is a variable that has been used in the code without being declared using the var,let, or const keywords.

    Attempting to use an undeclared variable will result in a runtime error.

    Example:console.log(x); // Uncaught ReferenceError: x is not defined

    An undefined variable,on the other hand,is a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value.

    Attempting to use an undefined variable will not result in a runtime error,but the variable will evaluate to the undefined value.

    Example:let x;
            console.log(x); // undefined
-->

Question:6 Write the code for adding new elements dynamically?

<!--
    document.getElementById("addParagraph").addEventListener("click", function() 
    {
    const newParagraph = document.createElement("p");
    newParagraph.textContent = "This is a new paragraph!";
    document.body.appendChild(newParagraph);
    }
);

    In this example,we create a new paragraph element using the createElement() method and set its textContent to "This is a new paragraph!".

    We then append the new paragraph to the body element using the appendChild() method.

Question:7 What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?

<!--
    ViewState and SessionState are both state management techniques used in ASP.NET to preserve data across HTTP requests.

    1) ViewState:
        Maintained at page level; it is specific to a single web page.

        Used to persist the state of controls and values between postbacks on the same page.

        Stored in a hidden field within the page and sent back and forth between the client and server.

        Data is not secure by default but can be encrypted for security.

        ViewState is lost when navigating to a new page12.

    2) SessionState:
        Maintained at session level; it is specific to a user session and can be accessed across multiple pages.

        Used to store user-specific data on the server, such as user preferences or shopping cart contents.

        Stored on the server, which can be in-memory or in a database, especially useful in web farms or web gardens.

        Data remains available until the session expires, which is typically after a period of inactivity.

        SessionState can be cleared programmatically, by the user, or due to a timeout12.

    In summary,
        ViewState is ideal for maintaining data within a single page, while SessionState is suitable for maintaining user data across multiple pages in a web application.
        Both serve to manage state in stateless HTTP protocol, but they do so at different scopes and through different mechanisms

Question:8 What is === operator?

<!--
    The === operator is a comparison operator in JavaScript that is used to compare two values for equality.

    It compares the values of two operands without type coercion,meaning that the values being compared must have the same data type.

        condition-1: The same data type and the same value
            Example: 1 === 1; // true
                     true === true; // true

        condition-2: The values are different data types, even though they have the same value
            Example: 1 === "1"; // false ()

        condition-3: The values are different data types and different values
                    Example: 1 === 2; // false

    When using the === operator,it is important to ensure that the values being compared are the same data type.

    If the values are not the same data type,the === operator will always return false.

    It is important to note that the === operator is not the same as the == operator.

    The == operator is less strict than the === operator
-->

Question:9 How can the style/class of an element be changed?

<!--
For style:
    To change the style of an element, you can use the style property to set one or more CSS properties.

    Example: document.getElementById("myElement").style.color = "blue";
    //This code sets the text color of the element with the ID "myElement" to blue.

For class:
    ADD:
        To add a class to an element, you can use the classList.add() method.
            Example:document.getElementById("myElement").classList.add("highlight");
                    //This code adds the class "highlight" to the element with the ID "myElement".

    Remove:
        To remove a specific class from an element using its name, you can use the classList.remove() method.
            Example: document.getElementById("myElement").classList.remove("highlight");
                      //This code removes the class "highlight" from the element with the ID "myElement".

    Toogle:
        If you want to toggle a class (i.e., if it exists, remove it, otherwise add it)
            Example: document.getElementById("myElement").classList.toggle("highlight");
                     //This code toggles the class "highlight" on the element with the ID "myElement".
-->

Question:10 How to read and write a file using JavaScript?

<!--
    To read and write files in JavaScript, you can use the built-in fs module in Node.js.

    To reading file:
        const fs = require('fs');
        // Read the contents of the file
        const contents = fs.readFileSync('example.txt', 'utf8');
        console.log(contents);

            In this example, the readFileSync method is used to read the contents of the file example.txt synchronously.
            The utf8 argument specifies the encoding of the file.
            The contents of the file are then logged to the console.

    To Writing file:
        const fs = require('fs');
        // Write some data to the file
        fs.writeFileSync('example.txt', 'Hello, world!');
        console.log('File written successfully.');

            In this example, the writeFileSync method is used to write the string Hello, world! to the file example.txt synchronously.
            The console.log statement is then executed to indicate that the file was written successfully.

Note:   that the fs module is not available in client-side JavaScript due to security reasons.
        Instead, you can use the fetch API or XMLHttpRequest to make HTTP requests to a server and read or write files that way.

Question:11 What are all the looping structures in JavaScript?

<!--
    JavaScript provides several looping constructs to iterate over data structures and execute blocks of code.

    Here are the different types of loops in JavaScript:

    1) For loop:
        This is the most common looping construct,which allows you to iterate over a block of code a specific number of times.

        Ex: for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++)
            {
            console.log(i);
            }

    2) For...in loop:
        This loop is used to iterate over the properties of an object.

        EX: const obj = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3};
            for (let key in obj)
            {
            console.log(key, obj[key]);
            }

    3) For...of loop: 
        This loop is used to iterate over iterable objects such as arrays, strings, and maps.

        EX: const arr = [1, 2, 3];
            for (let value of arr)
            {
            console.log(value);
            }

    4) while loop:
        This loop is used to execute a block of code while a specified condition is true.

        EX: let i = 0;
            while (i < 5)
            {
                console.log(i);
                i++;
            }

    5)while loop:
        This loop is used to execute a block of code while a specified condition is true.

        EX: let i = 10;
            do
            {
            console.log(i);
            i++;
            }
            while (i < 10);

Question:12 How can you convert the string of any base to an integer in JavaScript?

<!--
    We can convert a string to an integer by using the parseInt() conversion by default.

    But in other cases when the integer is represented in some other form we also need to pass the base string to decode it into the resultant number.

    Example:
        <script>
    let stringConversion = (string_value) => {
        console.log("Initial Type: " + typeof string_value);
        let integer_value = parseInt(string_value);
        console.log("Final Type: " + typeof integer_value);
        console.log(integer_value);
    };
    stringConversion("8475628");
</script>

output: Initial Type: string
        Final Type: number
        8475628
-->

Question:13 What is the function of the delete operator?

<!--
    The delete operator is used to delete a property from an object.

    It returns true if the deletion was successful,and false otherwise.

    Example:
            const obj = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3};
            delete obj.a;
            console.log(obj); // {b: 2, c: 3}
        In this example,we define an object obj with three properties,a,b and c.
        We then use the delete operator to remove the a property from the object.
        When we log the object,we can see that the a property has been removed.

        Note:The delete operator only works on object properties,not on variables or array elements.
-->

Question:14 What are all the types of Pop up boxes available in JavaScript?

<!--
    There are three types of pop-up boxes available in JavaScript - alert(), confirm(), and prompt().

        1) Alert() : 
            This box displays a message for the user's information.

            Once the user clicks OK,the alert box disappears.

            The user can't interact with the page until they dismiss the alert box.

                Ex: alert("This is an alert box!");

        2) Confirm Box: 
            A confirm box displays a message and two buttons: "OK" and "Cancel". 

            The user can click either button to close the confirm box,and you can use the confirm() function to determine which button the user clicked.

            If the user clicks OK,the result will be true.If the user clicks Cancel,it will be false.

                Ex: const result = confirm("Are you sure you want to continue?");
                    if (result) 
                    {
                    console.log("The user clicked OK.");
                    }
                    else
                    {
                    console.log("The user clicked Cancel.");
                    }

        3) Prompt Box:
            A prompt box displays a message,a text input field, and two buttons: "OK" and "Cancel".

            The user can enter text in the input field and click either button to close the prompt box.

            You can use the prompt() function to get the user's input.

                EX: const userInput = prompt("Please enter your name:");
                    if (userInput!== null)
                    {
                    console.log("Hello, " + userInput + "!");
                    }
-->

Question:15 What is the use of Void (0)?

<!--
    In JavaScript,void is an operator that can be used to explicitly specify that an expression should be evaluated without returning a value.

    It is often used in conjunction with the parentheses operator ( ) to evaluate an expression and discard its result.

    void(0) is a common idiom that is used to create a no-op (no operation) expression in JavaScript.

    It is typically used in situations where a function is expected to return a value, but the value is not needed.

        Example:<button onclick="void(0)">Click me</button>
            In this example,the onclick attribute is assigned to the void(0) expression.

            When the button is clicked,the expression is evaluated, but it does not return a value.

            This prevents the default behavior of the button,which would be to submit the form or navigate to a new page.

    Note:void(0) is not the same as undefined.
            undefined is a keyword that represents the absence of a value in JavaScript,while void(0) is an expression that evaluates to undefined.

Question:16 How can a page be forced to load another page in JavaScript?

<!--
    In JavaScript, you can force a page to load another page using the window.location object.
    
        Example of how to redirect to another page:window.location.href = "https://www.google.com";

    If you want to replace the current page history entry with the new URL (not allowing the user to go back to the original page using the back button),you can use:window.location.replace("https://www.google.com");

        Note:The window.location object is a global object that represents the current URL of the page.
-->

Question:17 What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML in JavaScript?

<!--
    innerHTML is a property that can be used to get or set the HTML content of an element.

    While it can be a convenient way to manipulate the DOM,there are some potential downsides to using it.

        1) Performance:
            Setting the innerHTML property can be slower than using other methods,such as textContent or appendChild(),because it involves parsing and rendering the HTML content.

            This can be especially noticeable when dealing with large amounts of HTML content.

            As the browser parses through the HTML,it may take time for the rendering engine to process each piece of markup.

        2) Security: 
            Using innerHTML can introduce security vulnerabilities,such as cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

            This is because it allows for the injection of arbitrary HTML content, which can include malicious scripts.

        3) Readability: 
            Using innerHTML can make code harder to read and understand,especially when dealing with complex HTML structures.
