Question-1: What is jQuery?

<!--
    jQuery is a popular JavaScript library that simplifies HTML document traversing,event handling,and animation. 

    It was created by John Resig in 2006 and has since become one of the most widely used JavaScript libraries.

    jQuery's syntax is designed to make it easier to navigate and manipulate the HTML elements on a web page.

    It uses a CSS-style selector syntax to select elements, which makes it easy for developers who are already familiar with CSS to learn and use jQuery.

    jQuery also provides a number of built-in methods for common tasks,such as handling user interactions,making AJAX requests, and manipulating the DOM.

        Overall, jQuery is a powerful tool that can help developers save time and write more efficient and maintainable code.

Question-2: How to Apply CSS Using JQuery, How to Add Class and Remove Class in Jquery, JQuery Animation?

<!--
    For CSS:
        To apply CSS using jQuery, you can use the .css() method. 

        This method allows you to set one or more CSS properties for the selected elements.

            Example:$("p").css("color", "blue");
            // Select all <p> elements and sets their color property to blue.

    For Adding Class:
        To add class to an element using jQuery, you can use the .addClass() method.

        This method adds the specified class or classes to the selected elements.

            Example: $("p").addClass("highlight");

    For Removing Class:
        To remove a class from an element using jQuery, you can use the .removeClass() method.

        The .removeClass() method removes a single class, multiple classes, or all classes from the selected elements.

            Example:$("p.highlight").removeClass("highlight");

    For Animation:
        jQuery also provides several animation methods that allow you to animate certain CSS properties of the selected elements.

        jQuery also provides animation methods which allow you to animate certain CSS properties over time.

        The most commonly used animations are show(), hide(), toggle(), slideUp(), slideDown(), fadeIn(), fadeOut(), and toggle.

            Example:$("p").animate(
                {
                    opacity: 0.5,
                    fontSize: "24px"
                }, 1000);

                //This code animates the opacity and font size of all paragraph elements on the page over a duration of 1000 milliseconds (or 1 second).
-->

Question-3: How to create slider with animation?

<!-- 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<script>
    $(document).ready(function()
    {
        var currentSlide = 0;
        var totalSlides = $('.slide').length;
    function showSlide()
    {
        $('.slide').eq(currentSlide).fadeOut(1000, function()
        {
            $(this).removeClass('active');
            currentSlide = (currentSlide + 1) % totalSlides;
            $('.slide').eq(currentSlide).fadeIn(1000, function()
        {
            $(this).addClass('active');
        });
        });
    }
        setInterval(showSlide, 5000);
    });
</script>
</head>
<body>
<div class="slider">
    <div class="slide"><img src="image1.jpg"></div>
    <div class="slide"><img src="image2.jpg"></div>
    <div class="slide"><img src="image3.jpg"></div>
</div>
</body>
</html>

In this example,the showSlide function fades out the current slide,removes the active class from it,calculates the index of the next slide,and adds the active class to it.
The setInterval function is used to call the showSlide function every 5000 milliseconds (or 5 seconds), creating a continuous animation loop.
