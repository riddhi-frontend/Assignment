Question-2: What is NPM in React Js?
<!-- 
    NPM stands for Node Package Manager, which is the world's largest software registry and package manager.
    It's a crucial tool for managing dependencies in React JS projects.
    In React JS, NPM is used to download and install JavaScript packages from the Node Package Manager registry.
    These packages can be libraries, frameworks, or tools that help with development, testing, and deployment.
    When you create a new React JS project, you'll typically have a package.json file that lists the project's dependencies.
    You can use NPM to install these dependencies by running the command npm install in the project directory.
    npm run build to create a minified production bundle.

Question-5: What is Components in React Js?
<!-- 
    Components can be nested inside other components, allowing for complex UIs to be built from simple, reusable parts.
    This modular approach to UI development makes React JS a powerful and flexible framework for building web applications.

    Components can be classified into two types: functional components and class components.
        1) Functional components:
            Functional components are simple JavaScript functions that take in props as arguments and return a React element.
            They are easier to write and read, and are preferred for simple UI elements.
                Example:
                    function Welcome(props)
                    {
                        return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
                    }

        2) Class components:
            Class components are more complex and can have their own state and lifecycle methods.
            They are useful for more complex UI elements that require more advanced behavior.
                    Example:
                        function App()
                        {
                            return <Greeting name="John" />;
                        }
    When the App component is rendered, it will display the Greeting component with the name "John", resulting in a greeting message of "Hello, John!".

Question-6: What is Header and Content Components in React Js?
<!-- 
    In React JS, components are the building blocks of a user interface.
    Header and Content components are just specific types of components that are commonly used in React applications.
    The Header component typically contains the navigation bar or any other elements that appear at the top of the page, such as a logo or a search bar.
        Example:
            import React from 'react';
            function Header()
            {
                return (
                    <header>
                        <h1>My React App</h1>
                        <nav>
                            <ul>
                                <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
                                <li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
                                <li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li>
                            </ul>
                        </nav>
                    </header>
                );
            }
export default Header;

Question-7: How to install React Js on Windows, Linux Operating System? How to Install NPM and How to check version of NPM?
<!-- 
    1. Install Node.js:
        React.js requires Node.js as a prerequisite. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server side.
        Visit the official Node.js website and download the installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
        Install Node.js by following the installation instructions.
            node -v

    2. Install React using create-react-app (CRA):
        Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to create your React project.
        Run the following command to globally install the Create React App tool:
            npm install -g create-react-app
        To verify the installation, type:
            create-react-app --version

    3. Create Your React App:
        Inside your project directory, run:
            npx create-react-app my-react-app
        Navigate to the newly created app directory:
            cd my-react-app

    4. Check NPM Version:
        Ensure that your NPM version is at least 5.2.0 or newer (required for create-react-app).

Question-8: How to check version of React Js?
<!-- 
    To check the version of React JS, you can use one of the following methods:
        1) Using package.json file:
            You can check the version of React JS in the package.json file of your project.
            The version number will be listed under the dependencies section for the react package.

        2) Using the command line:

Question-9: How to change in components of React Js?
<!-- 
    In React, components are the building blocks of your application. Let’s explore how to create and modify components:
        1) Creating Components:
            Components can be either Class components or Function components.
            Class components extend React.Component and include a render() method that returns HTML.
            Function components are simpler, return HTML, and are preferred in modern React development.

        2) Changing Component Color:
            To change a component’s color, you can use inline styling in JSX.
                Example:
                    const MyComponent = () => {
                        return <div style={{ color: 'red' }}>Hello, World!</div>;
                        };
            In this example, the text color of the div element will be red.

        3) Updating Component State:
            To update the state of a Functional Component, use the useState hook:
                const [state, setState] = useState({ text: 'Default value' });
